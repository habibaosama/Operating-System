operating System Assignment (Multi-Threading)A parallelized version of matrix multiplication can be done using one of these three methods:1- A thread computes the output C matrix i.e. without multi-threading. (A thread per matrix).2- A thread computes each row in the output C matrix. (A thread per row).3- A thread computes each element in the output C matrix. (A thread per element).
